# Spec Kit for Architectural Review Boards

*Structured architectural decision-making with AI assistance.*

**An open source toolkit for Architectural Review Boards (ARBs) to create well-structured Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and feature specifications.**

## What is This?

This toolkit helps Architectural Review Boards (ARBs) and engineering teams create consistent, high-quality architectural artifacts:

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** — Document technology choices, trade-offs, and rationale
- **Feature Specifications** — Define what to build and why, with clear acceptance criteria
- **Implementation Plans** — Translate specifications into actionable technical plans

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Upgrade Guide](upgrade.md)
- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

This toolkit is built on principles that support effective architectural governance:

- **Constitution-driven decisions** — A project constitution defines non-negotiable principles that guide all architectural choices
- **ADR-first architecture** — Every significant technology choice is documented with context, alternatives, and consequences
- **Quantifiable value** — Specifications must establish measurable success criteria and baselines
- **FinOps awareness** — Cost is a first-class concern in every architectural decision
- **Availability declarations** — Infrastructure decisions explicitly declare availability architecture (single/multi-region, active-active/passive)

## Use Cases

### Architectural Review Boards

- Standardize how architectural decisions are documented across teams
- Ensure all decisions capture alternatives considered and trade-offs
- Track cost implications of technology choices
- Maintain searchable, discoverable decision history

### Engineering Teams

- Document technology choices with proper context for future team members
- Create feature specifications that clearly separate what from how
- Validate specifications against organizational principles before implementation
- Generate implementation plans that trace back to requirements

### Compliance & Auditing

- Maintain audit trails of architectural decisions
- Document security and compliance considerations in context
- Track availability and disaster recovery decisions
- Record cost optimization decisions and rationale
